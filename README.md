# Team: Sentimental Smacking
---
## Application: ML Toolkit Exploration

## Semester: Spring 2022
---

## Overview:
This project will compare the accuracy scores of two ML toolkits (Weights and Biases, NLTK) to determine which performed better sentiment analysis on a dataset compiled of Twitter posts based on the incident that occurred between Will Smith and Chris Rock at the 2022 Oscars ceremony. We hope that in doing this, we will be able to answer the question of whether or not a GUI ML toolkit (like Weights and Biases) can handle NLP tasks up to par with industrial NLP libraries. Additionally, we hope to assess both toolkits from a software engineering perspective to comment on their usability, performance, and other attributes for programmers and non-programmers alike.

## Data:
For the terms of this project, the data is organized in a csv, where each column denotes the following:
- Column 1: Tweet Contents (text)
- Column 2: Tweet Sentiment (ChrisRock, WillSmith)
- Column 3: Tweet URL (url)

## Delegation of Duties:
- Jarred Bettencourt: Software Engineer
  - Will create the Twitter Bot and machine learning model creations
- Jeffrey Tran: Data Scientist
  - Will handle data analysis and any operations associated with the dataset

## Timeline:
- April 8th: Begin to gather data from Twitter, hand label, and obtain intuition for relevant tweets
- April 15th: ML models performs sentiment analysis using hand-labelled data
- April 22nd: Accuracy scores generated from ML model outputs are compared between the two amongst other pieces of data
- April 29th: Findings from the project and software investigation are documented in a tidied report

This was assault. Will Smith needed to be arrested at the Oscars. Chris Rock doesn’t even need to press charges.,Crock,https://twitter.com/miklv/status/1508293018721292292?s=20&t=BKEqG8BaG6hK0Ujj3k_6KQ
Can’t get over the irony that Will Smith bitch-slapped Chris Rock for a dumb joke about his wife but like... didn't care when other dudes slept with his wife.,Crock,https://twitter.com/Liz_Wheeler/status/1508451056216383494?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Will Smith owes Chris Rock a huge apology. There is no excuse for what he did. He’s lucky Chris is not filing assault charges. The excuses he made tonight were bullshit.,Crock,https://twitter.com/robreiner/status/1508309559273611265?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
What I’m not NOT seeing in all of this discussion was an immediate response that Chris Rock should be apologizing to Jada Pinkett Smith. Why? Was she not disrespected publicly? On a global stage? Why weren’t people taking up for *her*? Why is the focus not on her?,Wsmith,https://twitter.com/NYPoliticalMom/status/1508583018302160901?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Chris Rock is in no position to make fun of anybody else’s spouse. His husband is Kid Rock,Wsmith,https://twitter.com/veryimportant/status/1508596889326956550?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg

Chris Rock acknowledged he may have crossed a line and apologized with grace. Will Smith admitted that he acted in anger and inappropriately and he apologized. They’re good. Move on.,Neutral,https://twitter.com/maianimacule/status/1508602433701883906?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Physical violence is never the answer. Will Smith was wrong. Some jokes are evil. Chris Rock was wrong. They both can be wrong.,Neutral,https://twitter.com/funder/status/1508292584434810885?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
"What Will Smith did was wrong, no question. But Chris Rock making fun of someone with alopecia is no different than making fun of someone with a disability. There were no winners in that viral moment.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/RyanShead/status/1508308524513734656?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
"I need people to understand this: Just because Chris Rock was wrong, doesn't make Will Smith right.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/Sparty313/status/1508406910009200644?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg

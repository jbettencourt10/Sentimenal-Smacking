This was assault. Will Smith needed to be arrested at the Oscars. Chris Rock doesnï¿½t even need to press charges.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/miklv/status/1508293018721292292?s=20&t=BKEqG8BaG6hK0Ujj3k_6KQ

Will Smith owes Chris Rock a huge apology. There is no excuse for what he did. Heï¿½s lucky Chris is not filing assault charges. The excuses he made tonight were bullshit.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/robreiner/status/1508309559273611265?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
What Iï¿½m not NOT seeing in all of this discussion was an immediate response that Chris Rock should be apologizing to Jada Pinkett Smith. Why? Was she not disrespected publicly? On a global stage? Why werenï¿½t people taking up for *her*? Why is the focus not on her?,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/NYPoliticalMom/status/1508583018302160901?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg

"So Will Smith loses his mind, slaps Chris Rock, hurls obscenities then refuses to leave the venue for acting like a tool.

Chris Rock took that slap and remained calm and professional and continued on with the show. Will Smith looked like a fool trying to impress his wife so she doesn’t cheat on him again. He’s a joke.

Amazing intro and agree completely with your take on the slap incident. Felt so bad for Chris Rock and don’t understand why people like Denzel and Bradley Cooper were comforting Will Smith.

Will Smith is not a good person (check the receipts ie Janet Hubert and others). Neither is Jada. Neither is Chris Rick.

"He's apologized to Chris Rock, the Academy, it's members, the Public, Everyone. He's resigned from the Academy and he will be dealing with The Slap for a long time. No need to judge him harshly, he's doing enough of that himself. Move on ppl..",Neutral,https://twitter.com/IRMOUSE/status/1511056159859527684?s=20&t=JCyymwL2EN0L6MnFJaC6CQ
"Chris Rock and Will Smith are individuals, it’s really truly none of anyones business. The slap doesn’t change the price of gas, so why should anyone care either way about this encounter.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/JonLocke1684/status/1511051013066743811?s=20&t=JCyymwL2EN0L6MnFJaC6CQ

This was assault. Will Smith needed to be arrested at the Oscars. Chris Rock doesnï¿½t even need to press charges.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/miklv/status/1508293018721292292?s=20&t=BKEqG8BaG6hK0Ujj3k_6KQ
Canï¿½t get over the irony that Will Smith bitch-slapped Chris Rock for a dumb joke about his wife but like... didn't care when other dudes slept with his wife.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/Liz_Wheeler/status/1508451056216383494?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Will Smith owes Chris Rock a huge apology. There is no excuse for what he did. Heï¿½s lucky Chris is not filing assault charges. The excuses he made tonight were bullshit.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/robreiner/status/1508309559273611265?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
What Iï¿½m not NOT seeing in all of this discussion was an immediate response that Chris Rock should be apologizing to Jada Pinkett Smith. Why? Was she not disrespected publicly? On a global stage? Why werenï¿½t people taking up for *her*? Why is the focus not on her?,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/NYPoliticalMom/status/1508583018302160901?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Chris Rock is in no position to make fun of anybody elseï¿½s spouse. His husband is Kid Rock,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/veryimportant/status/1508596889326956550?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Will smith was in the right idc,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/RevivalOfPotara/status/1508277781154897932?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Chris Rock acknowledged he may have crossed a line and apologized with grace. Will Smith admitted that he acted in anger and inappropriately and he apologized. Theyï¿½re good. Move on.,Neutral,https://twitter.com/maianimacule/status/1508602433701883906?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Physical violence is never the answer. Will Smith was wrong. Some jokes are evil. Chris Rock was wrong. They both can be wrong.,Neutral,https://twitter.com/funder/status/1508292584434810885?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
"What Will Smith did was wrong, no question. But Chris Rock making fun of someone with alopecia is no different than making fun of someone with a disability. There were no winners in that viral moment.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/RyanShead/status/1508308524513734656?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
"I need people to understand this: Just because Chris Rock was wrong, doesn't make Will Smith right.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/Sparty313/status/1508406910009200644?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
"So Will Smith loses his mind, slaps Chris Rock, hurls obscenities then refuses to leave the venue for acting like a tool. Then they reward him with an award, let him give a 5 minute speech and give him a standing ovation. And they wonder why we call them Hollyweirdos.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/rdrhwke/status/1509679628717371396?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
Did anyone ever consider that the reason everybody gave Will Smith a standing ovation when he won his Oscar is because they've all been wanting to slap Chris Rock themselves for a while...,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/CarolynRParsons/status/1509679577295212547?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
I also want to hear Chris Rock apologize to Jada Pinkett Smith for the reason will walked up There to slap him!,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/Labelle14870844/status/1509679220485668873?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
Chris Rock took that slap and remained calm and professional and continued on with the show. Will Smith looked like a fool trying to impress his wife so she doesn’t cheat on him again. He’s a joke. He should’ve been escorted out and right into the back of a police car.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/bribribabyxoxo1/status/1509678325081456641?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
"Who really cares, Will Smith girlier slaps a smaller Chris Rock who just takes it at an award show nobody watches.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/leotherat13/status/1509678104154972160?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
This thing with Will Smith is really starting to piss me off Chris rock deserved more than the slap good for Will a person can only take so much before they snap if this was a normal situation then Chris would have acted back to he wanted to look innocent. He’s not!,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/betharthur26/status/1509677527534551049?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
"I can only go by what I felt. I laughed & said “right on.” When Kanye said “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” When I saw Will Smith slap Chris Rock I felt terrible for Chris Rock, angry at Smith for doing it, & angry about all of the people who did nothing.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/sniffdodoubleg/status/1509675375672057859?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
Chris Rock is a nice guy. I wouldve decked Will Smith and pushed him off the platform,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/bing96gnob/status/1509681879817113606?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
My heart goes out to Chris Rock. So so sad! I hope you are doing ok Chris!,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/srgallo57/status/1509681877459869696?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
"I'm like 2 seconds away from muting the words ""Will Smith"", ""Chris Rock"" and ""slap"". Stop the pearl clutching and move on. All the clout chasing is ridiculous.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/BigChrizzle/status/1509672270498828291?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw

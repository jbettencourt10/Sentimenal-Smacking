This was assault. Will Smith needed to be arrested at the Oscars. Chris Rock doesnï¿½t even need to press charges.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/miklv/status/1508293018721292292?s=20&t=BKEqG8BaG6hK0Ujj3k_6KQ
Cant get over the irony that Will Smith bitch-slapped Chris Rock for a dumb joke about his wife but like... didn't care when other dudes slept with his wife.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/Liz_Wheeler/status/1508451056216383494?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Will Smith owes Chris Rock a huge apology. There is no excuse for what he did. Heï¿½s lucky Chris is not filing assault charges. The excuses he made tonight were bullshit.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/robreiner/status/1508309559273611265?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
What Im not NOT seeing in all of this discussion was an immediate response that Chris Rock should be apologizing to Jada Pinkett Smith. Why? Was she not disrespected publicly? On a global stage? Why werenï¿½t people taking up for *her*? Why is the focus not on her?,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/NYPoliticalMom/status/1508583018302160901?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg

"Hello!? you need to comment on Will Smith fiasco. He needs to be punished for his actions. Actors, comedians should boycott the oscars until action is taken. Didn't watch this show and won't watch next year. Are we allowed to slap actors and performers now????",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/CarloSignora/status/1508957154358685698?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
Rock is the best. Got tix to see him here in Vancouver a couple weeks ago. Can't wait for his show. I expect he will make hay on the slap which actually was a sucker punch from cowardly Smith.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/longliner3/status/1508957114923855874?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"#WillSmith I don't condone violence & don't know if it was staged,although I thought it was real. In this case though I gotta say I'm with Will on this one,Chris deserved that bitch slap& the tongue lashing that followed!",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/TammyGauvin/status/1508956698987356168?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"So Will Smith loses his mind, slaps Chris Rock, hurls obscenities then refuses to leave the venue for acting like a tool. Then they reward him with an award, let him give a 5 minute speech and give him a standing ovation. And they wonder why we call them Hollyweirdos.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/rdrhwke/status/1509679628717371396?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
Did anyone ever consider that the reason everybody gave Will Smith a standing ovation when he won his Oscar is because they've all been wanting to slap Chris Rock themselves for a while...,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/CarolynRParsons/status/1509679577295212547?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw

Chris Rock took that slap and remained calm and professional and continued on with the show. Will Smith looked like a fool trying to impress his wife so she doesn’t cheat on him again. He’s a joke. He should’ve been escorted out and right into the back of a police car.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/bribribabyxoxo1/status/1509678325081456641?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw

"I can only go by what I felt. I laughed & said “right on.” When Kanye said “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” When I saw Will Smith slap Chris Rock I felt terrible for Chris Rock, angry at Smith for doing it, & angry about all of the people who did nothing.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/sniffdodoubleg/status/1509675375672057859?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw

If I was Will Smith I would have handled it like an ADULT! He could have spoken to Chris off stage .. not rushing the stage to slap him upside the head like a raged lunatic! Not everyone knows Jada has a medical condition.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/Jamie9113668455/status/1508956190704766976?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"Denzel and Tyler consoled Will but who consoled Chris Rock???he was the victim here and Will was the assailant. I don’t care who you are or where you are, you do not slap anyone in the face becus of words said. Will you were wrong and should be reprimanded",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/angelapwjd/status/1509373390397845511?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Amazing intro and agree completely with your take on the slap incident. Felt so bad for Chris Rock and don’t understand why people like Denzel and Bradley Cooper were comforting Will Smith. He should have said sorry to Chris Rock in his speech. And I agree he’s unraveling.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/LiggioMonica/status/1509902876218437670?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
I don’t condone what Will Smith did period no excuse for such violence and abuse. Why didn’t he slap that dude that had an entanglement with his wife ????,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/patricia_tard/status/1508955574146408459?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"Rock has been trash and problematic. ‘At your highest moment, be careful, that’s when the devil comes for you’ - Denzel to Will after the baby slap. He didn't say that to Chris, he said it to Will.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/TreBien_Beauty/status/1509269342772346883?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"You GenX and Millennial whiners are amazing. Chris Rock is a loud mouth jerk who hurt Will Smith's wife. So it's ok to inflict that kind of violence, but being disciplined by a slap is over the top? Rock got spanked, & he deserved it.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/FarleyXWilbur/status/1508594781575802881?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
my final opinion on the Chris Rock v. Will Smith/Jada Smith Oscar slap drama is that approval would have been unanimous if Will had German suplexed him instead,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/Jack_S_Wolfman/status/1509239339695452161?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Standing up yes but then taking a walk up stage to slap him is beyond me. There’s a proper way to go about will Smith didn’t even Chris rock a chance to apologize.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/Taekwondokid200/status/1508594724671827973?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg

The more I see about Chris Rock and Jada the less I’m like “Will Smith was wrong” and the more I’m like “Chris Rock deserved a beat down not just a slap”,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/imoteda/status/1510076000348082185?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"Yeah, Chris has NVLD, Non-verbal Learning Disorder. It gives him trouble with social one-one situations. It's similar to Asperger's or Autism but it's different. That slap must've been very confusing to him...I feel bad for him. Will/Jada were wrong for what they did.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/TG_Dilipan/status/1509855548593909760?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Just saw on Hannity a different angle of the Will Smith slapping Chris Rock and it shows Jada Pinkett-Smith laughing her ass off after the slap. Chris Rock needs to press charges and then sue the both of them.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/DebbieB4354/status/1509709497371082753?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g

"The worst of it is that Will asked him to STOP using his Wife and kids in his standup awhile back, for jokes. Chris wouldn't stop. That slap was 20 yrs in the making. Jada and Will have been married for 23 yrs.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/forthecomments1/status/1510353068554170376?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"It's not the first time Chris rock poked fun at her for her condition, and that's well known. So I'm not surprised that he got a slap..not saying it was right, but he deserved it nonetheless.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/SicariusXcv/status/1508590741580353541?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
Chris Rock has made Jada & Will & even their kids part of his act for decades. That slap was years in the making.,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/Fly_Sistah/status/1510271379249246216?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"You could tell that Rock was fully prepared to lay a comedic haymaker on Will and Jada after the slap, but held back. Definitely the bigger man. Lost respect for Will and gained it for Chris.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/paulwhite21/status/1509720557662613512?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"This is a dumb take no matter how I read it. Chris made fun of someone's disease at an awards show. This isn't a comedy club, mind your manners and you don't have to worry about a slap. Legal or not, right or wrong, disrespecting someone always comes with risks.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/BoogerLeader/status/1508590467377774600?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
Will Smith is a good role model for ALL kids! This never would have happened if Chris Rock had kept his mouth shut about Will’s wife! Why are there no consequences for Chris Rock? He seems to have a habit of mocking Will & Jada! Who wouldn’t get pissed & want to slap Chris Rock!,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/judy53350459/status/1510102906204266499?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g

"Will Smith should have beat his ass for all this BS reaction. Let me just say this, if Will slapped Chris Rock over a crass joke about Liza Minnelli being in a wheelchair…the villain would be Chris. Yes, people would agree a slap wasn’t right, but white women are protected.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/Jasamgurlie/status/1510035089572442115?s=20&t=oXHEIqTyTBw9nkOwYuzbzQ

"idk, maybe he will insult her again, he has a right to. Will has no right to hit Chris other than for self-defense. How do you know asking nicely wasn't going to work?

"I'm asking you - do you think Will was right to walk up there and slap Chris on live TV? Because I don't, no matter what Chris said. IMO, he could have spoken to Chris afterwards.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/goonerccc/status/1508588763169292288?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"The way Chris Rock thought he could say whatever he wanted and people like you excuse it.. The world needs to go back to random slaps in the mouth..

I've seen a lot on TikTok of them belittling Chris Rock saying he rightfully deserved the punch/slap because he mocked Jada's condition. But I can't believe there's people who try to defend him?

"Will Smith was entirely justified in his actions. Chris Rock made a very ableist, misogynistic joke about Will's wife to an audience of millions.

"I think it was fine for will Smith to slap Chris rock because it was really funny. Like imagine someone referencing a joke from last year's Oscars. Would you understand it? I wouldn't.

"He does have a point. Some ppl feel Will was justified in his assault, this wasn’t a backstage incident, the slap was heard/seen around the world and it impacts both their brands. Chris had to be the bigger man, he was emasculated; anyone checking on Chris, Will is not the victim",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/reelmoments1/status/1508932678430699534?s=20&t=oXHEIqTyTBw9nkOwYuzbzQ

"I not only had no problem with it, I applauded. Nobody hit the ground - the sting of a slap and a bruised ego for Chris. The fact that you would accept a personal apology is great. It's regal.

"Will Smith is a Great Actor, it's only natural that he will slap a Small Actor within his sphere of influence. Chris Rock should never have stood up on a stage right in front of him.

will smith apology was good. people are making too much of the slap itself but doubling down on it would be macho bullshit. i'd be surprised if chris rock doesn't eventually apologize too. maybe not in a press release but an interview where he admits he was playing with fire.,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/Ugarles/status/1508591573692473344?s=20&t=JCyymwL2EN0L6MnFJaC6CQ

You just got to witness in real time what happens in a man’s soul when he looks over to the woman he loves & sees her holding back tears from a “little joke” at her expense.

Will Smith was a never ending punch line at the Grammy’s. Some sort of rehab is on the horizon to make him a sympathetic figure again.

It was the right thing to do….if it had been the first time…ok. But to insult someone twice…in public…on national tv….it wasn’t funny and Chris deserved more than a slap!!,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/Margare36983672/status/1508583362025299969?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"Chris Rock also deserves an award for ""Best Moving Right Along With The Show""...maaaaan...I pictured the typical reaction to a slap and Rock didn't decide to follow through...it would've been a whole different night when the show ended abruptly",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/rodneytwit/status/1508484338840748052?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
Is there anyone on here (And I know the trolls will speak anyway) who really thinks that Will Smith had any right or reason to slap Chris Rock? I am speaking with someone who is trying as hard as he can to defend Will Smiths actions.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/RealCharlieBoye/status/1508564992198684683?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
Damn Will Smith if I was Chris rock I rather you to punched me not slap me like I’m a little boy the disrespect was all time high right there….but I feel you protect your queen as you see fit but a slap tho damn,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/2kBaby/status/1508516624768282628?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg

"Jada Pinkett Smith was verbally abused and publicly humiliated. Chris Rock had no right to say what he said, Jada recoiled and had a physical reaction to his words, while an audience laughed, my heart broke. Sometimes things can only be said w a slap.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/nmlssnwyrkr/status/1508446927830016002?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"Chris didn't attack a disability, but a haircut. I didn't know about the disability and it was a joke. Smith should have been taken out by the police. This was an assault.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/claudiaraesherm/status/1509917005167546377?s=20&t=Pw1mjJcWkEqlK_B3nUsgEQ
"Comedians poke fun of people all the time but usually it's about their shows or movies. This was personal, insensitive and cruel. You don't make fun of someone's illness on public television.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/suzanneo271/status/1509920756523753473?s=20&t=Pw1mjJcWkEqlK_B3nUsgEQ
It’s always wrong to slap someone. Period. If Wanda Sykes had been the person telling the GI Jane joke would Will still be justified?,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/PraversTat/status/1509922302212902912?s=20&t=Pw1mjJcWkEqlK_B3nUsgEQ
"Sorry, Stella, for the first time since following you I have to say “BS”. Smith had zero right to slap Chris Rock, & then to repeatedly say “shut your f**king mouth”. I’m disappointed you believe “thug rule” is the way to respond. Smith should have been escorted out & arrested",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/loutroporgos/status/1508422671272497155?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"Will Smith’s anger, frustration, anxiety, insecurity, etc. was completely displaced & misappropriated upon Chris Rock. In that moment, Rock wasn’t/has never been the source of Smith’s problem(s). That slap still doesn’t set right w/folks & it shouldn’t. Still shocking/still wrong",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/MrSoNso21/status/1510133132997005314?s=20&t=Pw1mjJcWkEqlK_B3nUsgEQ
Chris Rock was merely a vessel...he was the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. Will Smith...been wanting to slap hell out of a muthafucka. Chris was at the wrong place and the wrong time.

everyone’s focusing on if will was wrong or right to slap chris instead of acknowledging that no one should ever make fun of someone’s medical condition the fact some people are trying to justify chris rock’s “joke” makes me sick,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/trappedbylangue/status/1508546394579161107?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"I don’t care who you are; you do not have the right to put your hands on another person unless you’re physically defending yourself.

"What people don't understand is that ""jokes"" can be offensive. Will did laugh at first, but when he realized that Jada was upset, offended, and uncomfortable at being joked about for her illness, he had all right to slap Chris. I would have done the same for my woman.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/prettybaddie27/status/1508490234371223563?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg
"On Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.. Joke was in bad taste. Slap was wrong. Sometimes, there is no right and wrong.. just wrong and wrong-er.. If I'm honest, I feel sorry for Chris Rock (and Jada).

"Right, cause let’s say that Will didn’t slap him but said the exact same thing he said when he went back to his seat. People still would have said he was in the wrong & that it was “just a joke.” If that’s the case might as well get a hit in so Chris will stop testing him.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/NamuLovesKoya/status/1508496082514362369?s=20&t=KGKcfhmQooKS7Iub6ezuRg

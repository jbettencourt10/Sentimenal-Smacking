This was assault. Will Smith needed to be arrested at the Oscars. Chris Rock doesnï¿½t even need to press charges.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/miklv/status/1508293018721292292?s=20&t=BKEqG8BaG6hK0Ujj3k_6KQ
Canï¿½t get over the irony that Will Smith bitch-slapped Chris Rock for a dumb joke about his wife but like... didn't care when other dudes slept with his wife.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/Liz_Wheeler/status/1508451056216383494?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Will Smith owes Chris Rock a huge apology. There is no excuse for what he did. Heï¿½s lucky Chris is not filing assault charges. The excuses he made tonight were bullshit.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/robreiner/status/1508309559273611265?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
What Iï¿½m not NOT seeing in all of this discussion was an immediate response that Chris Rock should be apologizing to Jada Pinkett Smith. Why? Was she not disrespected publicly? On a global stage? Why werenï¿½t people taking up for *her*? Why is the focus not on her?,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/NYPoliticalMom/status/1508583018302160901?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Chris Rock is in no position to make fun of anybody elseï¿½s spouse. His husband is Kid Rock,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/veryimportant/status/1508596889326956550?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg

Chris Rock acknowledged he may have crossed a line and apologized with grace. Will Smith admitted that he acted in anger and inappropriately and he apologized. Theyï¿½re good. Move on.,Neutral,https://twitter.com/maianimacule/status/1508602433701883906?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
Physical violence is never the answer. Will Smith was wrong. Some jokes are evil. Chris Rock was wrong. They both can be wrong.,Neutral,https://twitter.com/funder/status/1508292584434810885?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg
"What Will Smith did was wrong, no question. But Chris Rock making fun of someone with alopecia is no different than making fun of someone with a disability. There were no winners in that viral moment.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/RyanShead/status/1508308524513734656?s=20&t=HXJYtGKadVd5g4w3a4t8Jg

"So Will Smith loses his mind, slaps Chris Rock, hurls obscenities then refuses to leave the venue for acting like a tool. Then they reward him with an award, let him give a 5 minute speech and give him a standing ovation. And they wonder why we call them Hollyweirdos.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/rdrhwke/status/1509679628717371396?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
Did anyone ever consider that the reason everybody gave Will Smith a standing ovation when he won his Oscar is because they've all been wanting to slap Chris Rock themselves for a while...,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/CarolynRParsons/status/1509679577295212547?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
I also want to hear Chris Rock apologize to Jada Pinkett Smith for the reason will walked up There to slap him!,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/Labelle14870844/status/1509679220485668873?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
Chris Rock took that slap and remained calm and professional and continued on with the show. Will Smith looked like a fool trying to impress his wife so she doesn’t cheat on him again. He’s a joke. He should’ve been escorted out and right into the back of a police car.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/bribribabyxoxo1/status/1509678325081456641?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
"Who really cares, Will Smith girlier slaps a smaller Chris Rock who just takes it at an award show nobody watches.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/leotherat13/status/1509678104154972160?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
This thing with Will Smith is really starting to piss me off Chris rock deserved more than the slap good for Will a person can only take so much before they snap if this was a normal situation then Chris would have acted back to he wanted to look innocent. He’s not!,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/betharthur26/status/1509677527534551049?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
"I can only go by what I felt. I laughed & said “right on.” When Kanye said “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” When I saw Will Smith slap Chris Rock I felt terrible for Chris Rock, angry at Smith for doing it, & angry about all of the people who did nothing.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/sniffdodoubleg/status/1509675375672057859?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
Chris Rock is a nice guy. I wouldve decked Will Smith and pushed him off the platform,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/bing96gnob/status/1509681879817113606?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw

"I'm like 2 seconds away from muting the words ""Will Smith"", ""Chris Rock"" and ""slap"". Stop the pearl clutching and move on. All the clout chasing is ridiculous.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/BigChrizzle/status/1509672270498828291?s=20&t=YwcjJbYMMZslW2f13pkmtw
"Denzel and Tyler consoled Will but who consoled Chris Rock???he was the victim here and Will was the assailant. I don’t care who you are or where you are, you do not slap anyone in the face becus of words said. Will you were wrong and should be reprimanded",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/angelapwjd/status/1509373390397845511?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Amazing intro and agree completely with your take on the slap incident. Felt so bad for Chris Rock and don’t understand why people like Denzel and Bradley Cooper were comforting Will Smith. He should have said sorry to Chris Rock in his speech. And I agree he’s unraveling.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/LiggioMonica/status/1509902876218437670?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"I know everybody's been waiting for my take on the Will Smith/Chris Rock slap of the century, and here it is: Denzel Washington is a badass.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/harry_schuh/status/1509552458422534151?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"Rock has been trash and problematic. ‘At your highest moment, be careful, that’s when the devil comes for you’ - Denzel to Will after the baby slap. He didn't say that to Chris, he said it to Will.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/TreBien_Beauty/status/1509269342772346883?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g

my final opinion on the Chris Rock v. Will Smith/Jada Smith Oscar slap drama is that approval would have been unanimous if Will had German suplexed him instead,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/Jack_S_Wolfman/status/1509239339695452161?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Will was obviously wrong for the slap. Chris was wrong for targeting Jada's physical appearance,Neutral,https://twitter.com/politico_z/status/1510269964577607685?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Not seen this angle yet. My heart goes out to Chris. He looks so sad and humiliated. Fuck Will Smith and Jada for laughing at the slap. Pair of bitches.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/clayblack75/status/1509804234438590482?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
The more I see about Chris Rock and Jada the less I’m like “Will Smith was wrong” and the more I’m like “Chris Rock deserved a beat down not just a slap”,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/imoteda/status/1510076000348082185?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"Yeah, Chris has NVLD, Non-verbal Learning Disorder. It gives him trouble with social one-one situations. It's similar to Asperger's or Autism but it's different. That slap must've been very confusing to him...I feel bad for him. Will/Jada were wrong for what they did.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/TG_Dilipan/status/1509855548593909760?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Just saw on Hannity a different angle of the Will Smith slapping Chris Rock and it shows Jada Pinkett-Smith laughing her ass off after the slap. Chris Rock needs to press charges and then sue the both of them.,ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/DebbieB4354/status/1509709497371082753?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
ppl making jokes abt jada forcing will to slap chris rock is just another case of ppl villainizing a woman who had nothing to do with the situation. it’s not funny especially when it’s men making the joke,Neutral,https://twitter.com/Kyliefaye__/status/1510237555484205061?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g

"The worst of it is that Will asked him to STOP using his Wife and kids in his standup awhile back, for jokes. Chris wouldn't stop. That slap was 20 yrs in the making. Jada and Will have been married for 23 yrs.",WillSmith,https://twitter.com/forthecomments1/status/1510353068554170376?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"If my brother is wrong then he's wrong, Chris Rock was wrong for joking about Jada Pinkett Smith's bald head and Will Smith was wrong to slap him. We don't uphold people in their wrong.",Neutral,https://twitter.com/sammctalk/status/1510298743412772872?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Chris Rock has made Jada & Will & even their kids part of his act for decades. That slap was years in the making.,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/Fly_Sistah/status/1510271379249246216?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
"You could tell that Rock was fully prepared to lay a comedic haymaker on Will and Jada after the slap, but held back. Definitely the bigger man. Lost respect for Will and gained it for Chris.",ChrisRock,https://twitter.com/paulwhite21/status/1509720557662613512?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Why didn't Jada slap Will for laughing at Chris's joke? If she's such a strong independant woman she should of slapped will for laughing then slapped Chris!,Neutral,https://twitter.com/rodney_bee/status/1509362632687509509?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
Will Smith is a good role model for ALL kids! This never would have happened if Chris Rock had kept his mouth shut about Will’s wife! Why are there no consequences for Chris Rock? He seems to have a habit of mocking Will & Jada! Who wouldn’t get pissed & want to slap Chris Rock!,WillSmith,https://twitter.com/judy53350459/status/1510102906204266499?s=20&t=OJjZLUm1hevAbTVViH944g
